Always knew about Github but never tried it out
I've heard it's useful for keeping track of code, but never really had any code to track, because I never thought I was good enough
Today, I've decided to use it to practise (re-learning) Python OOP and other Python packages to put into practise what I think I could use Git Hub for
I would also like a career change. I am an ICT/Computer Science teacher of 18 years, but I have never branched (pun intended) out into working on a coding project, let alone using Github.
